This project focuses only on data preprocessing, which is an essential step before applying any machine learning model. The main tasks I performed include handling missing values using methods like dropping rows or filling them with mean or mode, depending on the type of data. I also identified and removed outliers using the Interquartile Range (IQR) method to make the data cleaner and more reliable. Next, I scaled the numerical features using StandardScaler to bring all values to a similar range, which helps improve model performance. Finally, I split the dataset into training and testing sets using an 80-20 ratio. This preprocessing pipeline helps prepare the data for accurate and efficient analysis in the next stages of machine learning.
